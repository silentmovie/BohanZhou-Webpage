Tyler, an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, set out to truly grasp the concept of **Wasserstein interpolation**. Although this idea is far from new, it remains a fascinating and subtle phenomenon.

Given two measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, one may define the Wasserstein interpolation through either a given optimal transport map $T$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Wass_int_map}
\mu_t = ((1-t)x+tT(x))_{\sharp}\mu_1;
\end{equation}

or a given optimal transport plan $P$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Wass_int_plan}
\mu_t = ((1-t)x+ty)_{\sharp} P.
\end{equation}

As the animations above illustrate, it can behave in surprisingly unstable ways, at least in numerical experiments.

Consider two pairs of point clouds — blue at time 0 and red at time 1. In the top figure, the two clouds meet at a perfect right angle (90°), while in the bottom figure, the angle is slightly perturbed to 84.55°. Despite the small geometric difference, their Wasserstein interpolations diverge dramatically: the left one deforms smoothly, like kneading soft dough, whereas the right one almost performs a rigid rotation — more like a spinning baguette than a loaf being reshaped.

This contrast reveals both the beauty and the complexity of the Wasserstein interpolation. Optimal transport theory provides a partial explanation, yet a full understanding remains elusive — especially when we aim for predictable and controllable interpolations in practical applications.

Our current implementation owes much to Prof. Peyré’s excellent open-source experiments [[1]], particularly his formulation of optimal transport via linear programming. Moving forward, we plan to experiment with faster modern solvers [[2]] and explore more general multi-marginal OT (MMOT) frameworks [[3]] to push these ideas further.

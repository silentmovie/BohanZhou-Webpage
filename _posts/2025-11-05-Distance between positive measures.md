<h5><span style="color:#00703C">Understand the Back-and-Forth method Deeper </span></h5>
<!--end_excerpt-->

In the undergraduate independent study on Optimal Transport theory, Shirley and Wenxuan explore the back-and-forth method \[[1]] in greater depth, with the goal of extending it to more versatile applications.

They implemented the method entirely in Python \[[2]], handling both 1D and 2D datasets, and visualized some key steps in this algorithm, particularly the Jacobian computations related with the pushforward map. Moreover, a recent proposed metric (WOP distance \[[3]]) between positive measures integrates naturally into this framework. They also developed a numerical solver for computing this metric.

### Course Reflections

*“It is rare in a math course for students to speak,”* one of my students once remarked. I believe that encouraging reflections and discussions during lectures provides valuable opportunities to turn mistakes and misunderstandings into active learning experiences, helping students build confidence in their reasoning. Here are some sample presentations.

### Teamworks

*"I enjoyed being able to work with groupmates on a presentation and broadening my understanding of numerical analysis as well as programming."* quoted from my course evalutions. Here are some sample presentations credits to my wonderful students.

We propose a class of discrete state sampling algorithms based on Nesterovâ€™s accelerated
gradient method, which extends the classical Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm. A momentum-based acceleration framework using damped Hamiltonian flows and the corresponding jump process are proposed.
In particular, the accelerated gradient flow of the relative Fisher information demonstrates the advantages of the algorithm in estimating
discrete score functions without requiring the normalizing constant and keeping positive
probabilities.

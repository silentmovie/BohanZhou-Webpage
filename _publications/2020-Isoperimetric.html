Buttazzo, Carlier and Laborde proposed a variational model for some biological models of bilayer membranes. The model consists of an isoperimetric problem with a nonlocal term involving the Wasserstein distance. In this article, we adpot a new approach that is valid in any dimensions, and provide a partial existence and regularity results.
